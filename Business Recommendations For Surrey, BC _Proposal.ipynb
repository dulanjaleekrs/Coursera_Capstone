It is a member municipality of the Metro Vancouver regional district and metropolitan area. Mainly a suburban city, Surrey is the province's second-largest by population after Vancouver and the third-largest by area after Abbotsford and Prince George. Seven neighbourhoods in Surrey are designated town centres: Cloverdale, Fleetwood, Guildford, Newton, South Surrey, and City Centre encompassed by Whalley</p>\n\n<p>In 2016 the population was recorded at 517,887, an increase of 10.6% from 2011. This made it the 12th largest city in Canada, while also being the fifth-largest city in Western Canada (after Calgary, Edmonton, Winnipeg and Vancouver). Surrey forms an integral part of Metro Vancouver as it is the second largest city in the region, albeit while also serving as the secondary economic core of the metropolitan area. When combined with the City of Vancouver, both cities account for nearly 50% of the region's population. In recent years, a rapidly expanding urban core in Downtown Surrey, located in Whalley has transformed the area into the secondary downtown core in Metro Vancouver.</p>\n\n|Canada 2016 Census     | Population | % of total population |\n| ----------- | ----------- |------------ |\n| South Asian  | 168,040     |32.4% |\n|Chinese|39,890|7.7%|\n|Filipino|\t31,865|\t6.2%|\n|Southeast Asian|\t13,010\t|2.5%|\n|Black\t|9,455\t|1.8%|\n|Korean|\t9,285|\t1.8%|\n|Latin American|\t7,065\t|1.4%|\n|Arab\t|5,765|\t1.1%|\n|West Asian|\t3,720\t|0.7%|\n|Japanese|\t2,850|\t0.6%|\n|<strong>Other visible minority</strong>|\t1,995|\t0.4%|\n|<strong>Mixed visible minority</strong>|\t6,320|\t1.2%|\n|<strong>Total visible minority population</strong>|\t299,245|\t57.8%|\n|<strong>Total Aboriginal population</strong>|\t13,460|\t2.6%|\n|<strong>Total population</strong>|\t517,887|\t100%|\n\n<p> As of 2010, Surrey had the highest median family income of CDN$78,283, while BC provincial median was $71,660, and national's median was $74,540.
